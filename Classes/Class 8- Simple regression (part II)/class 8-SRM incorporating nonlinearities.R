# incorporating non-linearities using log transformations

# example: 
reg_wage_educ <- lm(wage~educ, wage1)
reg_logwage_educ <- lm( log(wage) ~ educ, wage1  )
stargazer(reg_wage_educ, reg_logwage_educ, type = "text")
# which one is better?


#----------------------------------------------------------
# you want to see the plots?

par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # seeing both plots in one graph!
# wage vs education plot
plot(wage1$educ, wage1$wage, xlab="Education" , ylab = "Wage", col="blue")
abline(reg_wage_educ, col="red" , lwd=3)

# log(wage) vs education plot
plot(wage1$educ, log(wage1$wage), xlab="Education" , ylab = "Log(wage)", col="blue")
abline(reg_logwage_educ, col="red" , lwd=3)



# Do you see the heteroskedasticity when we use wage instead of log(wage)!  
plot(x= wage1$educ, y=resid(reg_wage_educ), col="blue")
abline(h=0,col="red", lwd=3)

plot(x= wage1$educ, y=resid(reg_logwage_educ),col="blue")
abline(h=0,col="red",lwd=3)






# just for fun
par(mfrow=c(1,3)) # seeing both plots in one graph!
x <- seq(1,10,0.5)
y=x^2 + x^3
plot(x,y)
plot(x,log(y))
plot(log(x),log(y))

stargazer(lm(y~x), lm(log(y)~x), lm(log(y)~log(x)), type="text")
